What if we saw the bigger picture as not just the application you are creating but the future long term goal. What if we thought about building components so that they are extendable, theme-able and reusable across different code bases. If we could do that then we would be able to deliver applications at a much faster pace. We would be able to scale much easier. It's not easy but that is exactly why Bit Harmony was built.
